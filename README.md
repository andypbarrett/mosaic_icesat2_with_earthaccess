# Access MOSAiC ICESat-2 Tracks with `earthaccess`
This tutorial demonstrates how to use `earthaccess` to search for and access ICESat-2 tracks that were near the Polarstern Drift during the MOSAiC project.  The tutorial was originally developed for the NASA ICESat-2 Science Team.  It was updated to use the new developments in `earthaccess` and was presented in it's current form at the Openscapes Community Call: A welcome to NASA Earthdata and earthaccess.

The demonstration was developed to run in the Openscapes 2i2c Hub in AWS region us-west-2.  This allows efficient access to data in the NASA Earthdata Cloud, which is hosted in the same region.  However, the workflow should work from a local machine just a lot more slowly.

To run the demonstration you will need to clone the repo in you hub compute instance.

```
$ git clone
```
